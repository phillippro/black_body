# An MCMC algorithm for fitting modified black body formula to spectrum
##The usage of the code
The functions are put in func_post.R, the main code is Bayes_fit.R and the black_plot.R is for plotting. Since the Bayes_fit.R is only an example code, the user should change it for their own perpurse.

To run the code, the user simply install R environment and then type
```
Rscipt Bayes_fit.R
```
in the command line or type
```
source('Bayes_fit.R')
```
in the R consoler.

Since the code is self explanatory, the user can adapt them for different MCMC fittings. Comments and suggestions are welcome and can be sent to fengfabo@gmail.com .
